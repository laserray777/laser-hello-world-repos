# laser-hello-world-repos
repository created for the Hello World walkthrough in Github Guides
Created by Raymond Lee Gregowicz, CEO of Lasercrops. The purpose of this repos is to follow along the Hello World walkthrough
in Github Guides. I am an agile-adept Lasercrops Program Manager.
i am making change0 to README. Now see what git status showed. Immediately Before this change, git status command displayed:
"nothing to commit, working tree clean"
after editing README, git status displayed:
":On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")"

We see that Git is  tracking README file. Now figure out how to open this project in Visual Studio.
